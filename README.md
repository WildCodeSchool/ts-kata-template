## TS Kata template

This is a template for starting any kata or exercise in Typescript.
It features pre-installed and configured jest and typescript, as well as necessary type definitions. 

Code files and tests should both be placed in `src`.

Install dependences (i.e. `pnpm install`), then, to run tests in watch mode, use:

```
pnpm run test:watch
```

or

```
pnpm run test
```

to run tests only once.
